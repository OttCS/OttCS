# Better Than Vanilla
**or How to Adapt Modern Minecraft for that Nostalgia Hit**

*By Cooper Ott - August 9, 2024*

There's a lot of features that Mojang has added to the game since beta, but some have pulled the game in such disparate ways that it's made it harder for those who are nostalgic for the classic game to enjoy it again.

## Minecraft is a Sandbox
The game intends to inspire people to build and shape the world around them in order to tackle issues. Some things (like beds) completely remove some of this motivation. Some things **must** be tweaked in order to feel like the classic game we know, where night was dangerous and a dirt hut is all most people had time for to stay safe during their first one. Due to Minecraft's new drive to explore all of the biomes and structures, travel is inevitable, which is why setting a respawn point is not a bad idea. However, skipping night takes away the progress players achieve by either becoming better at combat or by building solutions to avoid it. Either is highly valuable and allows progress through the game.

Food is also an issue. Since hunger got added, there's been a weird system of constantly requiring food, even when you're not trying to survive something. Minecraft is a sandbox game with a *survival mode*, but that mode should still feature Minecraft's core gameplay. Hunger should be removed, as well as natural regeneration. This will actually encourage investment into good healing sources like potions and golden foods.

I'm working on a datapack that solves this: it's extremely small and only tweaks a few gamerules, but it makes the game feel a lot more rewarding. I'll add the link to the github repo when it's done.

The nether, since 1.16, has been very cool, leading to extremely dangerous but unique gameplay. Slight tweaks (like the amplified nether mod/datapack) make this feel fresh and exciting all over again, I cannot recommend this enough.

The end is lacking in a dramatic way. While every other part of the game is about building and overcoming obstacles, the dragon is a mandatory fight where the dragon actively destroys blocks. Not to mention how boring the actual end is. After the impressive and sometimes stunning overworld and underground generation, followed by the weird, corrupted nether, you get: yellow cobblestone with black and purple enemies. The Nullscape mod/datapack is very useful for making the generation much more unique, adding new biomes that are actually rewarding to see.
