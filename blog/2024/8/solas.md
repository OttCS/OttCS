# SOLAS
**A Simply Organized, Lightweight Adventure System**

*By Cooper Ott - August 19, 2024*

I play tabletop games (not as often as I would like to), and I usually end up running them. Over the actual decade that I've been playing Dungeons and Dragons, something has stuck out to me: **Getting people to learn the game is hard**.

Maybe it's just the group that I play with, or maybe I don't explain the game well enough. Either way, some players just give up when faced with character creation and just say "choose something for me" despite it resulting in not understanding how their character works (or general non-investment). This is actually why I have an old project called portable dnd ([check it out here!](https://github.com/OttCS/Portable-DnD)) which provides an easier way to choose ability scores and a race. It works pretty well, and one of my friends gave me this glowing review:

> what was it, modifier point buy? The only genius thing dnd related you've done

Well, I try my best.

Regardless, I felt like there was more room to take out a lot of DnD that doesn't seem to get used, or just gets in the way. So I did some research (playing other board/tabletop games) and found what I liked and made sense. Starting from scratch is definitely worth it.

## The Early Versions
In the early days, I tried to stick closer to the 5e I knew. Characters had the same six stats, and the system mainly focused on homebrew fixes. A better death system, using d6s instead of 20s (still with modifiers). It was essentially just homebrew, but it was a start! It's easily summed up in the original [Why.md](https://github.com/OttCS/SOLAS/blob/8461d44419be1dd0e82b614a4fe103741d1634b1/Why.md).

I managed to get down the core of what makes SOLAS special six months later: the d6 system present to this day. A four or higher is a success, a six is worth two. Roll as many dice as your ability or spell, and count the successes. That's it. It's simple and straightforward, and it's easier to handle than separate to-hit and damage rolls, each with different modifiers.

At some point or another, I experimented with a PDF version, different settings, and much more, but in the end I settled on a somewhat medieval-fantasy setting. It's what I'm used to, and it's what I like. It's still totally adaptable for other settings, just if I'm writing spells it just fits better with the DnD vibes.

## The Modern Version
It has features added or tweaked as I use it more, but SOLAS has been a great experience both developing and playing. It lets me actually sit down with players completely new to ttrpgs, and start playing *with characters players made* in 15 minutes. There's a character sheet that I spent WAY too much time making, but it prints very easily on 8.5x11 paper and looks solid enough. I'm even experimenting with writing a more full setting! But that takes a while, especially for a solo dev.

But hey, it's what I do for fun, and to do a little bit of game design. It's two years in and still going strong, and I can't wait to see where it is two more years down the line.
