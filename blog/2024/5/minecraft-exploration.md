# What Made Minecraft Awesome
**Why doesn't it still feel that way?**

*By Cooper Ott - May 25, 2024*

Minecraft is an incredible game which is still the best-selling of all time with over 300 MILLION copies, but not a lot of consistent players. Sure we all have our two-week Minecraft phase where we boot up a server with friends that dies out as soon as the ender dragon gets killed, but why?

This is not a widespread view of the issue: I think a lot of people may have their own ideas for why the game doesn't hit as hard anymore, but I think there's a couple things that people often overlook.

## How has Minecraft changed?
It's a game about mining and crafting, sure. But the updates over the game's life have radically changed the way players interacted with that core game. Version one released in 2011 with brewing, enchantments, and The End. It introduced the very concept of the end of the sandbox game.

Mojang then went on a string of updates adding more to explore with different types of "dungeons" and biomes. 1.2 introduced zombie sieges on villages, jungle biomes, and abandoned mineshaft bridges. 1.3 only added jungle and desert temples, and finally 1.7 released tons of new biomes.

But 1.3 brought something bigger, the bed. Now, you didn't have to have shelter of any kind because you could skip straight through to the day without monsters appearing, and in 1.4 it updated your spawnpoint in case you died. I'll elaborate on how detrimental this is to the game later, but for now it securely removed the need for a base that you'd keep safe so that you could still do stuff at night.

Then came an interesting update, 1.8. It added some solid dungeons that required trial and error and lots of planning, the ocean monument. However, this was suddenly a combat-focused dungeon, unlike what we've seen before. They also added "variants of stone" in the form of diorite, andesite, and granite, which received lots of criticism for just cluttering up inventory space. Hunger was also added, rather than simply eating food to heal injuries directly, it was now a constant resource that needed to be managed.

And then there was the combat update. 1.9 added tipped arrows, made axes deal more damage than swords, shields, sweep attacks with swords, dual wielding, and lingering potions. To compensate for the new strength that players could achieve, the ender dragon fight was made more difficult, and another combat-focused dungeon was added in the end cities. For a game whose strengths are mining and crafting, adding a lot more complexity and difficulty to a *somewhat functional* combat system? This was the first major split in the fanbase, with some players to this day sticking with version 1.8.

1.10 was the first update that was fully developed under Microsoft's new ownership, and added more combat challenges with husks and strays to deserts and tundras. Up next, 1.11 added... another combat dungeon with the woodland mansion. For something called the exploration update, it didn't really encourage it, with the mansions being twice as rare as mushroom islands and the best thing you can find in them is a diamond chestplate and an enchanted golden apple. At the point in the game where you're looking for them, you probably already have a diamond chestplate. Enchanted golden apples are also just as common in the monster spawner dungeon chests.

1.12 added colored concrete and terracotta blocks and parrots. While nice for people looking for a *specific shade* to build with, it didn't add too much. It didn't break too much either, as these were optional blocks that weren't going to clutter up inventory space when you were casually exploring. Due to the drastic changes in the next

And then we reached 1.13, the aquatic update. Drowned and phantoms got added, which simply clamped down on how you had to play the game. You couldn't swim anywhere without getting attacked, and you couldn't even stay up to work on your base through the night. While the update breathed some life into the oceans with underwater ruins and shipwrecks, they just were another two combat dungeons due to the new ocean being hostile, with far too good loot because of how common they are.

The 1.14 Village and Pillage update completely reworked how people played the game. The villages were now easy sources of absurdly good loot, all properly themed to their environment. Pillager outposts also generate, with chests containing emeralds and enchantment books. Overpowered loot is now the most attainable it has ever been, given that you can simply steal a village's wheat, sell it to farmers for emeralds and attain full iron armor within minutes of starting the game. At this point, this is the second best armor in the game.

1.15 was an embarrassment of an update. Mojang had the backing of Microsoft for over five years, and produced a bee and honey-related blocks and items. This does not change the game in any meaningful way.

The nether update, 1.16, brought brand new biomes to the nether, mobs to inhabit them, new (combat) dungeons, and ruined portals. While an incredible update that brought a lot of people back to the game as well as introducing a new material better than diamond, it felt distinctly less... hellish. There's lush greenery, fire can be blue in certain biomes, and while hostile, there's signs of life and civilization everywhere.

1.17, 1.18, and 1.19 were supposed to be one update, so I will address them as such. The Caves and Cliffs update added:

- Copper (a useless ore)
- New world generation which introduced new biomes and blocks (which actually encourage underground exploration)
- A new combat dungeon with ancient cities, which are intended to be post-End

1.20 added a new cherry grove biome which is arguably nice, but some of the most useless other features ever created, rivaling 1.15.

# So this is it?
Absolutely not, and this isn't just a "the game was better when it was indie" rant. Understanding the changes that were made to the game and which ones people go back to is important for understanding what exactly made the game special. If we look at the split between the 1.2 player arc and the modern (1.20, soon 1.21) one, a huge distinction can be seen:

>You got some stone tools and made a small shelter to spend the night in, because dying meant you'd get sent all the way back to world spawn and likely lose your gear. Maybe doing some mining to get up to iron gear, you can finally make armor and brave the outside world. Eventually you may find a village, but zombie sieges made these extremely dangerous unless you set up proper defenses. After mining for diamonds, you've acquired the best gear in the game, and you feel on top of the world. Which it's only fitting now that you travel to the fiery wasteland of the nether, doing difficult battle with new creatures and carefully balancing your food supply to recover from injuries; you're knocked down a peg and struggle to survive once again. Eventually you'd come home with what you needed, stock up for the ultimate battle and journey to find the stronghold, and kill the dragon.

This seems like an epic journey in 1.2, filled with struggle, triumph, and exploration. Let's look at 1.20:

>Kill some sheep to make a bed, and travel until you find a village where you get unlimited food and shelter, and can reappear here if you die. Which won't happen from monsters, because you can sleep through every night. When you find a ruined portal, you only need to spelunk for a bit until you find exposed diamonds and gold in a cave, and you're ready to go to the nether. Trade with piglins for ender pearls and sneak through the forests until you find the nether fortress, and kill the blazes in close quarters. Head back to the overworld and specialize your gear in how you want to take down the ender dragon. On your way to the stronghold, you'll find some combat dungeons that you're far overleveled for, and go kill the dragon. You can end here, or loot the end cities and then the ancient cities.

There's much less of an actual hero's journey here, as you reach excellent gear far faster with less effort.
## Can this be fixed?
1.21 will soon be here, and with it another optional combat dungeon that'll probably take place after the nether. 1.21 is not the fix that we've been waiting for, as a lot of people have been hoping. The solution is actually looking at what made Minecraft special to begin with.

The mining. The crafting. The endless exploration you could do, setting up bases as you went. Building something that felt unique and catered to how you played the game.

We need this game back.

The problem isn't Microsoft owning it, the microtransaction-filled Bedrock edition and spinoff media, or Mojang's lack of innovation and effort in new updates.

The problem is that the game is confused.

Beds can skip night (and a majority of combat), and phantoms actually penalize players who try to stay up through it. Given this, it seems like the game uses combat as a punishment. If that's the case, then why does every single "dungeon" revolve around combat and upgrading your weapons? There's more upgrades to make to your weapons and armor than there are total tools in the game, even if we're not counting enchantments.

If we remove the ability to skip combat through trivial means (besides hiding in a dirt box for 10 minutes) and tune the combat system in the game to be more enjoyable (hunger, I'm looking at you), we can have a game like Terraria: it gets complemented all the time for its tightly tuned combat and progression system.

Or we can make the game more about exploration and building, mining and crafting. Making your mark on the environment and building up your resources and influence over the world around you. There aren't many games that attempt this, except for one: **the original Minecraft 1.0**.

I'm not saying all new features are bad, play 1.0 and enjoy it. Almost all new biomes are great, and the caves and cliffs world generation is spectacular. Jungle and desert temples are cool, even if they need some variation. The deep dark and ancient city are super cool, and I even do like finding beehives in the game!

## The Takeaway
It's possible that we've simply outgrown the game, but there's nothing in it that makes it "for kids." I think most of us started playing this game when it was about exploring, building castle walls around villages, and being proud when we mined diamonds and got through the game's tougher challenges with them. It was a sandbox game, where you had limitless possibility, and even still every player shared a hero's journey.

The Minecraft parodies that resonated with us are about this lost game, one where your defenses could be breached by a creeper and a zombie siege could get in, making the kingdom you built become dangerous. A game where you were mining for diamonds at night outside of your base, when a creeper might blow you up and take your diamonds.

We can't get back into Minecraft, because that Minecraft isn't there anymore.
