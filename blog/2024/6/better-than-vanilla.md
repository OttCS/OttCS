# Better Than Vanilla
**A proposal for a Better Than Adventure, but for modern vanilla**

*By Cooper Ott - June 4, 2024*

There are lots of incredible features that Mojang has added to the game since the beta, but not all of them were good, and deviated FAR from the original vision of the game. A lot of what Better than Adventure does fixes a lot of the issues of modern versions, but some features of modern truly were worth adding.

# What is Minecraft
The game should inspire people to go mining and craft everything the game has to offer, and to build structures to help you accomplish this. You should be afraid of monsters at night when you start out and build a small base near spawn. You should have to balance risk and reward when doing dangerous things, not just have a stack of food in one inventory slot. The game should be light on RPG elements, and should focus on being a sandbox.

## Beds
Destroy the classic memories we have of the game, where mining at night was risky and walls were necessary protections. Setting a new respawn point should be expensive and late game: **like the modern respawn anchor**. You have to achieve diamond tools and explore the nether first (arguably it should be exploring more of the nether). And there should be no skipping night, ever.

## Anvils, Unbreaking, and Mending
Minecraft is not an idle game that should be tried to be optimized away. Even repairing weapons still lets you automate the process of enchanting by removing it. If a player wants to interact with an aspect of the game, they should actually interact with it.

## Gear Progression
Different types of armor should provide different types of protection (similar to enchants now). This means that just going full diamond/netherite isn't the best in some scenarios, and chain, leather, and gold armor can serve a purpose. Better than adventure hit this one on the head.

## Villagers
Villagers are a huge bandage for other problems. Tons of free food and iron (golem farm) were made necessary due to the introduction of hunger and the increasing number of recipes that need iron. The implementation of villages also helps with the totally nomadic direction the game is going, where you will always be able to find shelter and be able to respawn close to where you die. Enchanting was "tedious and random" and has been all but scrapped for enchanted books sold in villages.

## Sprinting and Food
You can outrun any mob in the game, which makes night completely trivial to sprint through if you're nomadic and have a couple pieces of food. In calmer parts of the game, you still have to stop and eat every once in a while no matter what. The beta 1.7 mechanic was perfect: if you aren't doing something dangerous, you don't have to interact with food. If you are, each food item takes up a whole inventory slot so you have to stock up and plan for expeditions.

## Other Dimensions
While the warped and crimson forests bring some really interesting new locations to explore, there's little point for the warped forest besides endermen (pearls) and the crimson forest has hoglins (food). These are not necessarily bad, and bring to mind Terraria's Corruption and Crimson. However, terraria is a game about combat gear progression, and Minecraft is supposed to be about exploration. These areas should each contain a unique loot item, and should be MORE "warped" and "corrupted," requiring building and careful planning to traverse safely. Maybe crying obsidian and 

The rest of the nether is great at being hellish: lots of exposed area with ranged enemies lurking, a place that lets you gain extremely valuable items but with a huge detriment.
