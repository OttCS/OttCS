# Projects
**I'll try to keep track of what I'm working on**

## "Software"
**I write some code, sometimes**

### ZephyrJS
**If it exists, there will be a JS library for it**

ZephyrJS is a Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) javascript library that brings game-engine features like input handling, file io, audio and music to your JS projects. Grab your favorite web renderer and bring Zephyr alongside it to get a fully-featured game engine experience.

## Misc
**It's not *necessarily* software...?**

### SOLAS
**A Beginner-Friendly Tabletop Roleplaying System, Since July 2022**

Crunchy systems have their place and purpose, but if you're just trying to have some fun with TTRPG beginners? SOLAS (Simply Organized, Lightweight Adventure System) has you covered. Easy and flexible character creation, D6-based system, and as few rule caveats as possible.
